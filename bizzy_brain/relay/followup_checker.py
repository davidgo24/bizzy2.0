Review the following conversation history. The last message is from the owner (Melissa).
Determine if a follow-up message from Bizzy (the AI) is needed to keep the conversation flowing or to provide further assistance.

Consider the following:
- If the client's last message is a simple acknowledgment (e.g., "thanks", "ok"), a confirmation, or does not require a direct response, then NO follow-up is needed.
- If the client asks a new question, provides new information that requires a response, or indicates a need for further action, then YES a follow-up is needed.
- IMPORTANT: If the client's last message indicates a new emergency, distress, urgency, or a clear need for owner intervention (e.g., "help", "emergency", "messed up", "ASAP"), then NO follow-up is needed from Bizzy. This is to ensure the owner intervention logic is triggered instead.
- If the client's message is a direct answer to a question Bizzy just asked, and no further action is immediately required from Bizzy, then NO follow-up is needed.

Respond with ONLY 'YES' if a follow-up is needed, and 'NO' if it is not.
